    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Mathematical models of infectious diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "Infectious diseases represent a major cause of illness and mortality in humans and non-human animals. They are caused by pathogens, living entities such as viruses, bacteria, or helminths (worms). Transmission routes include human-to-human contact (including sexual contacts), vector-borne transmission (transmission from human to human via an intermediate species), or zoonotic transmission (direct transmission to humans from an animal reservoir). Sustained human-to-human transmission results in an outbreak of infection, which can have several different outcomes:\n",
    "- Epidemic infection: a sudden outbreak of infection that acts on a short temporal scale;\n",
    "- Pandemic: a large-scale outbreak which spreads between continents;\n",
    "- Endemic infection: an infection that establishes itself over a long time scale in a particular region or population.\n",
    "Effective modelling of infectious disease dynamics requires us to choose the right tools for pathogen, host population, and type of outbreak we are dealing with. Vector-borne diseases require different models to human-to-human transmissible infections, and the dynamics of endemic infections require different considerations to those of novel infections.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can divide infectious disease models into two broad classes:\n",
    "- **Deterministic models** describe the infectious disease dynamics using a set of rate-based equations. These models are accurate in large populations where the population is approximately a continuum.\n",
    "- **Stochastic models** allow for randomness, and account for the inherently discrete nature of populations of individuals. This makes stochastic models more realistic than deterministic ones, but also more challenging to analyse and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will introduce the basics of deterministic modelling."

    "### 2.2 Compartmental models \n",
    "\n",
    "Compartmental models are the most widely-used class of model in infectious disease dynamics (and are common in many other areas of mathematical biology). Each individual in the population is assigned to a compartment based on some characteristic of interest, with individuals in the same compartment sharing the same status *(W3)*. The infectious disease dynamics are determined by the interactions between people of different compartments. The key to formulating such a model is to choose a set of compartments and transitions which are appropriate to the situation we want to model. In this workshop we will introduce a few commonly used compartmental structures, and focus on what is probably the most commonly used of all: the SIR model."

    "## 3. SIR without demography\n",
    "### 3.1 Model formulation\n",
    "To begin with, let's consider a closed population without demography (births and deaths) or migration. The \"no demography\" assumption is reasonable when we are considering the dynamics of an outbreak over a short timescale, where the expected number of demographic events is much smaller than the expected number of infectious events.\n",
    "Our host population is divided into three compartments corresponding to different infectious statuses:\n",
    "- Susceptible ($S$): naive individuals who have no immunity to infection\n",
    "- Infectious ($I$): individuals who have been infected and are currently able to transmit this infection to susceptible individuals\n",
    "- Recovered ($R$): individuals who have undergone a period of infection and are now immune to further infection\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to transition between compartments: a susceptible individual can become infectious, resulting in an $S\\to I$ transition, or an infectious individual can recover, resulting in an $I\\to R$ transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system can be represented schematically, as follows:\n",
    "<img src=\"img/SIR_NoDemography.png\" style=\"width: 30%;\"/>\n",
    "In this workshop, our focus is on translating schematics like this into systems of differential equations, but we emphasise here that they can also be interpreted as a stochastic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a set of differential equations, we need to assign rates to our infection and recovery events. Let $S(t)$ be the proportion of the population which is susceptible at time $t$, $I(t)$ be the proportion which is infectious, and $R(t)$ be the proportion which is recovered. To obtain an $S\\to I$ transition, we need an infectious individual to make an infectious contact with a susceptible individual. If individuals mix homogeneously, then the rate at which these contacts occur will be directly proportional to the proportional sizes of the susceptible and infectious populations, and so we can express this rate as $\\beta SI$. The parameter $\\beta$ is a per-capita infectious contact rate, defining the rate at which infectious individuals make social contacts **and** transmit infection along these contacts. To obtain an $R\\to I$ transmission, we need an infectious individual to recover because their innate immune response has fought off the infection. If the expected amount of time during which a case is infected is given by $T$, then the population-level rate at which recoveries occur will be $\\gamma I$, where $\\gamma=T^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/SIR_NoDemographyBetaGamma.png\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "These two rates define our entire system, and we obtain a system of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "          \\frac{dS}{dt}= -\\beta SI\\\\\n",
    "          \\frac{dI}{dt}= \\beta SI - \\gamma I\\\\\n",
    "          \\frac{dR}{dt}= \\gamma I\n",
    "        \\end{array}\n",
    "      \\right.$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a closed population, one way to check the equations are properly written is to sum them all up. Without demography, $\\sum_{C_i\\in Classes} \\frac{dC_i}{dt} = 0$. For instance, in our model: $\\frac{dS}{dt}+\\frac{dI}{dt}+\\frac{dR}{dt}=0$"

    "The infectious prevalence (that is, the proportion of infectious individuals) initially grows exponentially, but quickly slows down as the proportion of susceptible individuals decreases and the pathogen runs out of new people to infect. The infectious prevalence peaks somewhere around day 15, at which point the rate of recoveries begins to outstrip the rate of new infections. Eventually the infection dies out, with most of the population now recovered."

    "## 4. Basic reproductive ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "One measure of the intensity of an outbreak is the basic reproductive ratio, denoted $R_0$. It is defined as *the expected number of secondary cases arising from a primary case in an entirely susceptible population*. The basic reproductive ratio is a *threshold parameter*; if $R_0<1$ then an outbreak of infection in a susceptible population will immediately die out, whereas when $R_0>1$ the infection can reach epidemic proportions. More generally, if the initial fraction of susceptibles $S(0)\\leq \\frac{1}{R_0}$, then $\\frac{dI}{dt}<0$ and the infection dies out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate $R_0$ for our SIR model without demography by considering the secondary cases generated by a single case introduced to a susceptible population. In this setting we expect all of the infectious contacts made by the infectious individual to be with susceptible individuals, so that the number of cases they generate per unit time is $\\beta$. Since their expected infectious duration is $T=\\gamma^{-1}$, we see that the basic reproductive ratio of the SIR model without demography is given by $R_0=\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$. Since $\\beta$ is dependent on both biological factors (how much infection each case spreads) and social factors (how many contacts each case makes), it follows that the basic reproductive ratio is dependent on both the pathogen and the population in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "One application of the basic reproductive ratio is estimating the **herd immunity threshold** for a given infection. This is the proportion of the population which needs to be immune to an infection to reduce the effective reproductive ratio to 1. The effective reproductive ratio (usually denoted $R_E$) can be intepreted as the mean number of cases generated by a single case after a control measure has been applied. Vaccination acts to control infection by reducing the proportion of susceptibles in the population, and will eradicate an infection when $S$ is reduced below $\\frac{1}{R_0}$. The herd immunity threshold is thus given by $1-\\frac{1}{R_0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reproduction numbers $R_0$ for common infectious diseases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Ebola, 2014:          1.51 to 2.53\n",
    "    - H1N1 Influenza, 2009: 1.46 to 1.48\n",
    "    - Seasonal Influenza:   2 to 3\n",
    "    - Measles:              12 to 18\n",
    "    - MERS:                 around 1\n",
    "    - Polio:                5 to 7\n",

    "\n",
    "For the SARS pandemic in 2003, scientists estimated the original $R_0$ to be around 2.75. A month or two later, the effective $R_0$ dropped below 1, thanks to the tremendous effort that went into intervention strategies, including isolation and quarantine activities *(W5)*.\n",

    "Experiment with different values of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ in the implementation of the SIR model we defined above. In particular, you should pay close attention to what happens when the ratio between $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ is smaller than or greater than $1$."

Infected humans immediately become exposed ($E_H$) and then transition to the infectious class ($I_H$) after the intrinsic incubation period. Finally, infectious humans move to recovered class ($R_H$). Mosquitoes enter the susceptible class at birth and die naturally (from any class at a specific rate). If susceptible mosquitoes($S_v$) bite infectious humans, they are moved to the exposed ($E_v$) class and then become infectious ($I_v$).\n",

If an equilibrium is stable, then when we move a small distance away from that equilibrium we should quickly return. If an equilibrium is unstable, then when we move a small distance away from that equilibrium we will carry on moving away indefinitely, or until we reach another equilibrium. A full stability analysis would involve linearising the system and calculating its eigenvalues(see, for example *(Arfken, 1985, W4)*), which we will not detail here. In the SIR model with demography, it turns out that when $R_0<1$ the single disease-free equilibrium is stable, so that if we introduce a small amount of disease we quickly return to the disease-free equilibrium. When $R_0>1$, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and the endemic equilibrium is stable, so that if we are at endemic equilibrium and either add or remove some infection, the prevalence will quickly revert to its endemic level.\n",
