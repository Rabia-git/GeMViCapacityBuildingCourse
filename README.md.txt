The material in this repository was originally prepared for use in a series of online workshops on infectious disease modelling, arranged by researchers at the University of Warwick and KEMRI-Wellcome Trust as part of the NIHR-funded [GeMVi (Application of Genomics and Modelling to the Control of Virus Pathogens) project](https://gemvi.kemri-wellcome.org/). The intended audience consisted primarily of academics from PhD-level upwards interested in moving into infectious disease modelling. The material should be broadly accessible to readers with a background in quantitative science. Some of the mathematical content may be unfamiliar for readers coming from biological or medical backgrounds, but we provide worked examples for much of this content which should help to make it more lucid.

For each workshop we have provided a notebook written in the R programming language containing a textbook-style introduction to a topic in infectious disease modelling along with worked examples and coding exercises. Each workshop notebook is accompanied by a corresponding solutions notebook.

The original schedule of the workshops was as follows:

- Pilot workshop, Deterministic Compartmental Models, delivered February 12th 2020 by Rabia Aziza and Joe Hilton
- Workshop 1, Deterministic Compartmental Models, delivered December 2nd 2020 by Rabia Aziza
- Workshop 2, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, delievered December 16th 2020 by Joe Hilton
- Workshop 3, Stochastic Comparmental Models, delivered January 20th 2021 by Rabia Aziza
- Workshop 4, Spatial Spread I, delivered February 3rd by Andrea Parisi
- Workshop 5, Spatial Spread II, delivered February 17th by Andrea Parisi
- Workshop 6, Fitting to Time Series Data I, delivered March 10th by Sam Brand
- Workshop 7, Age-structured Models, delivered May 19th by Joe Hilton

This workshop series is still ongoing and we will upload the corresponding notebooks following each future workshop. At time of writing (May 2021) each workshop has only been delivered once and we will likely revise the content and notebooks if they are delivered again in future.
